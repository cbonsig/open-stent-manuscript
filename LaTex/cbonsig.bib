	Abstract = {Stents have been used in numerous medical disciplines, as well as in oral surgical procedures. Uses range from rebuilding mandibles and constructing new ureters, to keeping coronary arteries patent after angioplasty. The earliest use of the word "stent" to describe this item was in 1916, when a Dutch plastic surgeon described how he used a dental impression compound as a matrix around which to form tissue in the process of rebuilding a shattered face. What is generally unknown is that the word "stent" derives from the name of an English dentist, who invented this impression compound in 1856.},

	Abstract = {A new type of endovascular prosthesis was inserted in 28 animals and evaluated for several factors, including thrombogenicity, tendency to migrate, critical implant zones, and incorporation into the vascular wall. The new prosthesis is a woven, multifilament structure of stainless steel alloy; its inherent elastic, self-expanding characteristics hold it against the vessel walls. Forty-seven endoprostheses (3-5 mm in diameter, 15-50 mm long) were percutaneously implanted with either a 6-F introducer sheath, a coaxial 9-F catheter, or a 0.014-inch (0.036-cm) guide wire into the femoropopliteal, coronary, carotid, and renal arteries and iliac veins. Anticoagulant or platelet antiaggregating agents were not used before or after implantation. Angiographic and histologic analyses showed that the prosthesis had a very low thrombogenicity when it was well adapted to the native vessel diameter and that it was incorporated into the vessel wall by a new intima by the 3d week after implantation. No migration occurred, and branch vessel flow was preserved even in those vessels in which ostia were traversed by the prosthesis. This prosthesis has potential for clinical application in the treatment of postangioplasty restenoses, particularly in the coronary arteries.},

	Abstract = {A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a remnant tunnel between the right and left atrium that has been found to be present more frequently in young patients with stroke and in sufferers of migraines. Percutaneous closure of the tunnel has become commonplace, replacing surgical closure. Various devices have been developed, most of which consist of atrial discs joined by a connecting wire. The Coherex FlatStent provides a new paradigm for PFO closure as it consists of a nitinol frame covered with polyurethane foam that is deployed within the PFO tunnel. Animal and Phase I and II studies have shown this device to be safe, effective and easy to use. More than 100 patients have now received such a device with excellent closure rates such that it may become an attractive and important development in patients with the clinical sequelae of PFO.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To quantify femoral-popliteal vessel deformation during thigh contraction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven subjects underwent a magnetic resonance (MR) examination of the femoral-popliteal vasculature on a 1.5 T system. A custom 3D balanced steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequence was implemented to image a 15-20-cm segment of the vasculature during relaxation and voluntary isometric thigh contraction. The arterial and venous lumina were outlined using a semiautomated method. For the artery, this outline was fit to an ellipse whose aspect ratio was used to describe arterial deformation, while venous deformation was characterized by its cross-sectional area. RESULTS: Focal compression of the femoral-popliteal artery during contraction was observed 94-143 mm superior to the condyle that corresponds to the distal adductor canal (AC) immediately superior to the adductor hiatus. This was illustrated by a significant reduction (P < or = 0.05) in aspect ratio from 0.88 +/- 0.06 during relaxation to 0.77 +/- 0.09 during contraction. A negligible change in arterial aspect ratio was observed inferior to the AC and in the proximal AC. Similarly, venous area was dramatically reduced in the distal AC region during contraction. CONCLUSION: Rapid 3D SSFP MR angiography of the femoral-popliteal vasculature during thigh contraction demonstrated focal compression of the artery in the distal AC region. This may help explain the high stent failure rate and the high likelihood of atherosclerotic disease in the AC. J. Magn. Reson.},

	Abstract = {Nitinol self-expanding stents are effective in treating peripheral artery disease, including the superficial femoral, carotid, and renal arteries. However, fracture occurrences of up to 50% have been reported in some stents after one year. These stent fractures are likely due to in vivo cyclic displacements. As such, the cyclic fatigue and durability properties of Nitinol-based endovascular stents are discussed in terms of an engineering-based experimental testing program. In this paper, the combined effects of cardiac pulsatile fatigue and stent-vessel oversizing are evaluated for application to both stents and stent subcomponents. In particular, displacement-controlled fatigue tests were performed on stent-like specimens processed from Nitinol microtubing. Fatigue data were collected with combinations of simulated oversizing conditions and pulsatile cycles that were identified by computer modeling of the stent that mimic in vivo deformation conditions. These data are analyzed with non-linear finite element computations and are illustrated with strain-life and strain-based constant-life diagrams. The utility of this approach is demonstrated in conjunction with 10 million cycle pulsatile fatigue tests of Cordis SMART Control((R)) Nitinol self-expanding stents to calculate fatigue safety factors and thereby predict in vivo fatigue resistance. These results demonstrate the non-linear constant fatigue-life response of Nitinol stents, whereby, contrary to conventional engineering materials, the fatigue life of Nitinol is observed to increase with increasing mean strain.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to contrast the performance of self-expanding and balloon-expandable stents. While both approaches to stenting have proven to be successful in treating a wide range of vascular disease, there are significant differences in the philosophy behind and properties of the two types of stents. Many of these differences, such as strength, stiffness (or compliance), recoil, dynamic scaffolding, vessel conformity and fatigue resistance will be highlighted by studying the mechanics of the stent alone, and then of a stent within a vessel. These differences can be summarised by observing that self-expanding stents provide more anatomically-correct scaffolding, while balloon-expandable stents provide rigid and uncompromising reinforcement. Other differences, such as corrosion resistance, placement accuracy and visibility, will also be briefly summarised.},

Some of these properties cannot be found in engineering materials used for stents presently. This article explains the fundamental mechanism of shape memory and superelasticity, and how they relate to the characteristic performance of self-expanding stents. Nitinol stents are manufactured to a size slightly larger than the target vessel size and delivered constrained in a delivery system. After deployment, they position themselves against the vessel wall with a low, "chronic" outward force. They resist outside forces with a significantly higher radial resistive force. Despite the high nickel content of Nitinol, its corrosion resistance and biocompatibility is equal to that of other implant materials. The most common Nitinol stents are listed and described.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to quantify in vivo deformations of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) during maximum knee and hip flexion with use of magnetic resonance (MR) angiography to improve description of the complex, dynamic SFA environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Contrast medium-enhanced MR angiography was performed on the leg vasculature of eight healthy adults in the supine and fetal positions. The SFA was defined as the centerline path of the iliofemoral segment from the profunda femoris to the descending genicular artery. Deformations that resulted from flexion from the supine position to the fetal position were quantified with the SFA path and its branches. RESULTS: Fourteen SFAs shortened from the supine position to fetal position, whereas two lengthened. Six of eight left SFAs twisted counterclockwise, and seven of eight right SFAs twisted clockwise. Straightness percentages for supine and fetal SFAs were 99.1%+/-0.4% and 98.7%+/-0.6%, respectively. From the supine position to the fetal position, the SFA shortened 13%+/-11% (P.8) between left and right limbs; however, no significant correlation existed for SFA twist angle. CONCLUSIONS: Complex and varying vascular and muscular anatomy among study participants made SFA lengths and deformations from the supine position to the fetal position unpredictable a priori; however, there were strong symmetries between left and right SFAs in terms of arc length, length change, and direction of twist. The data show that, from the supine position to the fetal position, the SFA tended to shorten and twist substantially, suggesting these as possible fracture mechanisms and also providing important parameters for stent design.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the effects of swallowing and side-to-side head turning on stents in the internal carotid artery. METHODS: Seven patients (4 men; mean age 76.9 years) who underwent carotid artery stenting for the treatment of atherosclerotic cervical carotid artery disease were examined with cine fluoroscopy. Geometric processing techniques were used to quantify carotid stent deformations due to head turning and swallowing forces. The variables measured included radial, axial, and crush deformations, as well as radii of stent curvatures during tested maneuvers. RESULTS: Radial deformations of the stented vessels were significantly less than axial and crush deformations, ranging from -10.2% to 15.5%. Axial deformations in response to both swallowing and head turning were positive (average 4.5%, range -14.5% to 14.1%), indicating a general lengthening of the stented vessel due to biomechanical motions. Crush strains exhibited the largest range of all of the deformation modes during both swallowing and head turning. Strain values ranged from -18.7% to 25.9% in the anteroposterior direction and from -25.6% to 21.9% in the lateral direction. Head turning produced fairly symmetrical crushing of the stent. Conversely, swallowing resulted in a preferential medial crush of the stented artery due to contraction of the pharyngeal constrictor muscles. Curvature measurements revealed a tightest radius of curvature of approximately 1.5 cm during ipsilateral head turning, with average values during both swallowing and head turning of approximately 10 cm. CONCLUSION: In general, head turning toward the stented artery produced greater deformation in the vessels than swallowing. Since patients are expected to undergo far more swallowing cycles than head turns, however, the accumulated deformations from swallowing may be more significant and should be considered in the design of fatigue resistant stents for carotid arteries.},

	Abstract = {The knowledge of dynamic changes in the vascular system has become increasingly important in ensuring the safety and efficacy of endovascular devices. We developed new methods for quantifying in vivo three-dimensional (3D) arterial deformation due to pulsatile and nonpulsatile forces. A two-dimensional threshold segmentation technique combined with a level set method enabled calculation of the consistent centroid of the cross-sectional vessel lumen, whereas an optimal Fourier smoothing technique was developed to eliminate spurious irregularities of the centerline connecting the centroids. Longitudinal strain and novel metrics for axial twist and curvature change were utilized to characterize 3D deformations of the abdominal aorta, common iliac artery, and superficial femoral artery (SFA) due to musculoskeletal motion and deformations of the coronary artery due to cardiac pulsatile motion. These illustrative applications show the significance of each deformation metric, revealing significant longitudinal strain and axial twist in the SFA and coronary artery, and pronounced changes in vessel curvature in the coronary artery and in the inferior region of the SFA. The proposed methods may aid in designing preclinical tests aimed at replicating dynamic in vivo conditions in the arterial tree for the purpose of developing more durable endovascular devices including stents and stent grafts.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To quantify in vivo deformations of the abdominal aorta and common iliac arteries (CIAs) caused by musculoskeletal motion. METHODS: Seven healthy subjects (age 34+/-11 years, range 24-50) were imaged in the supine and fetal positions (hip flexion angle 134.0 degrees +/-9.7 degrees ) using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography. Longitudinal strain, twisting, and curvature change of the infrarenal aorta and CIAs were computed. The angle between the left and right CIAs and translation of the arteries were also computed. RESULTS: Maximal hip flexion induced shortening (5.2%+/-4.6%), twisting (0.45+/-0.27 degrees /mm), and curvature changes (0.015+/-0.007 mm(-1)) of the CIAs. The angle between the CIAs increased by 17.6 degrees +/-8.6 degrees . The iliac arteries moved predominantly in the superior direction relative to the aortic bifurcation, which would induce compression and bending, thus increasing curvature and angle between the CIAs. The abdominal aorta also exhibited shortening (2.9%+/-2.1%) and twisting (0.07+/-0.05 degrees /mm) deformation associated with the hip flexion. CONCLUSION: Although this study was limited to a few healthy young adults, musculoskeletal motion, specifically hip flexion, caused significant in vivo morphological changes (shortening, twisting, and bending) of the arteries. Predominant superior translation of the CIAs was observed, which suggests that preclinical testing of cyclic superior-inferior translational motion may aid in predicting stent-graft fractures. In turn, stent-graft design could be improved, decreasing overall stent-graft-related complications.},

	Abstract = {Aims: The histologic response to self-expanding stent implantation into advanced atherosclerotic lesions has not been systematically investigated. We tested the hypothesis of whether gradual expansion of advanced atherosclerotic plaques by self-expanding stents would be an appropriate method to seal atherosclerotic lesions without causing plaque disruption as is usually observed with balloon-expandable stents. Methods and results: Twelve New Zealand white rabbits were fed an atherogenic diet (1% cholesterol) followed by arterial denudation and injection of washed autologous erythrocytes. Nitinol self-expanding stents of two different stent designs and strengths (n=12 for SX and n=12 for Micro-SX) were implanted into the previously formed lesions within the abdominal aorta six weeks following injection of erythrocytes. Four weeks following stent implantation, animals were sacrificed, specimens harvested and processed for histology. Histomorphometry was performed on stented and adjacent non-stented regions. Atherosclerotic lesions were composed of foam cells, cholesterol clefts and necrotic plaque. While SX stents showed an unfavourable outcome with respect to vessel remodelling and the percentage of uncovered stent struts, Micro-SX stents had fewer uncovered stent struts, less positive remodelling and less plaque injury. Conclusions: Nitinol Micro-SX self-expanding stents might be a valuable approach to seal high risk atherosclerotic lesions.},

	Abstract = {To evaluate venous reflux in 56 lower limbs of 32 consecutive patients, hemodynamic tests, ascending and descending phlebography, and supine and erect quantitative duplex scanning were performed and the clinical severity was classified (class 0 = 15, class 1 = 19, class 2 = 8, and class 3 = 14). Of the 56 lower limbs, 22 (40%) had severe swelling and hyperpigmentation with or without ulcer (classes 2 and 3). Adequacy of the clinical severity classification was supported by the hemodynamic results. Radiologic and ultrasound findings were described by axial grading, multilevel/multisystem point, and multisegment scoring systems. Applying these evaluation systems, the phlebographic and scan results correlated poorly. There was no relationship between the radiologically obtained average reflux grade or points and the clinical severity. An erect quantitative duplex Doppler test assessed by the multisegment scoring system correlated best with the severity classification. The predictive value of this test to diagnose severe reflux leading to severe symptoms (classes 2 and 3) was 77% compared with 35% to 44% for descending phlebography. The study suggests that erect quantitative segmental duplex Doppler reflects the degree and distribution of venous reflux more accurately than does descending venography.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Several techniques are currently available for the detection of venous reflux. We have attempted to determine the relative value and accuracy of available techniques to develop a logical strategy of investigation in reflux venous insufficiency. METHODS: The morphologic distribution of venous incompetence (erect duplex and descending venography); the results of ambulatory venous pressure measurement, venous refilling time, the Valsalva test, and air-plethysmography (venous refilling index, VFI); and the clinical severity were described in 118 consecutive limbs. In an attempt to validate the tests, results were correlated with the clinical severity classification (class 0, n = 34; class 1, n = 42; class 2, n = 11; class 3, n = 31) and with a standardized quantification of reflux (multisegment score) as seen on standing duplex Doppler scanning with rapid deflation cuffs. RESULTS: Twenty-nine percent of limbs with severe venous disease (class 2/3) had pure deep insufficiency, only 6% had pure superficial disease, and the remainder had a combination. A history of previous thrombosis and the presence of posterior tibial vein incompetence were markedly common with ulcer disease (84% and 42%, respectively). The duplex Doppler multisegment score correlated strongly with clinical severity classification (r = 0.97). The venous refilling time and VFI had the highest sensitivity in identifying severe venous disease (class 2/3), and the ambulatory venous pressure had excellent specificity. CONCLUSIONS: For noninvasive determination of reflux, the combination of VFI and duplex scanning not only localized reflux but also separated severe clinical vein disease from mild, with high sensitivity and specificity. Air plethysmography may also provide valuable information regarding calf muscle pump and outflow obstruction.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: This study compares three different modes for measuring hemodynamically significant outflow obstruction in chronic venous insufficiency: (1) arm-foot venous pressure differential combined with foot venous pressure elevation to reactive hyperemia, (2) outflow fraction determination with plethysmography, and (3) calculation of resistance from simultaneously obtained foot venous pressure and calf volume curves. METHODS: The three techniques were compared in 15 normal limbs and 19 limbs with documented previous deep venous thrombosis. Outflow fraction and resistance were also measured after reactive hyperemia was induced. RESULTS: The arm-foot venous pressure measurements delineated patients with grades 1 through 4 obstruction (Raju's grading). Resistance calculations correlated well with this grading except in patients with severe grade 4 obstruction, in whom low resistance was found. Outflow fraction determinations had marked overlapping between the different obstruction grades, substantially decreasing sensitivity to detect hemodynamically important outflow obstructions. No correlation with the resistance calculations was shown. Inducing reactive hyperemia did not alleviate these findings. The failure of the outflow fraction and resistance methods to detect significant obstruction is probably attributable to the use of plethysmographic techniques for volume measurement, which appears to give false-negative results as a result of a regional volume shift within the lower limb. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of the arm-foot vein pressure differential and the foot vein pressure elevation after reactive hyperemia seems to be the only reliable test currently available for detecting and grading global chronic obstruction.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: We investigated the factors determining postexercise pressure and the relationship of venous valve closure and venous column segmentation to ambulatory venous pressure changes. METHODS: Valve closure and venous segmentation were observed during dynamic ascending phlebography in 40 nonrefluxive limbs and by duplex imaging in 25 normal limbs in healthy volunteers. Simultaneous volume (air plethysmography) and pressure studies during calf exercise were also carried out. Some studies used a simple mechanical model comprised of a collapsible latex tube ("calf pump") and a graduated "popliteal" valve. RESULTS: The femoropopliteal venous column above the popliteal valve remains unsegmented and continuous during ambulatory venous pressure changes in response to calf muscle contraction. Therefore ambulatory venous pressure changes cannot be explained purely on the basis of hydrostatic column pressure changes. Postexercise pressure appears to be determined by a complex set of factors: (1) physical segmentation of the venous column below the popliteal valve (i.e., tibial valve closure); (2) tube collapse below the closed valve, which further aids in the breakup of the hydrostatic column pressure and dampens the effect of any reflux through or around the closed valve; (3) ejection fraction, which influences the degree of tube collapse; and (4) the interaction of the resultant pressure forces with the wall properties of the venous pump. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism of ambulatory venous pressure reduction is complex and multifactorial. The importance of venous wall characteristics as a determinant of postexercise pressure has not been previously appreciated. Changes in venous wall property after a thrombotic process, for example, could conceivably influence ambulatory venous pressure and recovery time in the absence of reflux.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE. In addition to degree of outflow obstruction and reflux and poor calf muscle pump function, vein wall compliance changes are important in understanding pathophysiology of venous disease. This study compares the pressure/volume relationship in post-thrombotic and healthy legs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. Prospective and comparative study. SETTING. Vascular laboratory. PARTICIPANTS. Investigations were performed on 24 apparently normal legs and 30 post-thrombotic limbs as confirmed by phlebography. METHOD. Dorsal vein pressure and absolute calf volume decrease were recorded simultaneously during outflow form the leg after release of the cuff during venous occlusion air-plethysmography with and without reactive hyperemia. The slope of the pressure/volume outflow curve was calculated. In addition, the distensibility (= collapsibility) was determined as % volume decrease/mmHg. The popliteal and femoral vein diameters were measured in supine and erect position by ultrasound. RESULTS. With and without induced hyperemia the mean slope coefficients of post-thrombotic legs were significantly higher (0.52 +/- 0.22 and 0.53 +/- 0.18) than in normal (0.15 +/- 0.10 and 0.29 +/- 0.11), i.e., the curve steeper since the calf was stiffer, less compliant. The degree of outflow obstruction and severity of skin changes did not affect the slope measurement substantially. Collapsibility during venous outflow was significantly less in post-thrombotic legs. The post-thrombotic veins were less distended on standing. CONCLUSIONS: Post-thrombotic calves are less compliant than normal legs mainly due to less compliance of the vein wall, although theoretically reduced venous volume may contribute.},

This study suggests a method to determine the calf pressure/volume relationship by utilizing venous occlusion plethysmography combined with dorsal vein pressure. DESIGN. Comparison between two techniques of measuring calf pressure/volume relationship using air plethysmography with validation against popliteal vein diameter changes detected by duplex ultrasound. SETTING Vascular laboratory. MATERIALS. In 6 normal and 6 radiographically confirmed post-thrombotic lower limbs, the calf pressure/volume relationship was determined. The dorsal vein pressure was continuously recorded. Simultaneously calf volume changes were obtained by an air plethysmograph during venous occlusion plethysmography (outflow slope coefficient) and fractionated tilting of the subject from erect to supine position (volume at 40 mmHg). During the tilt, sagittal diameter of the popliteal vein was measured (% change/mmHg = distensibility). RESULTS. The outflow pressure/volume slope coefficient correlated significantly with the volume at 40 mmHg during tilt maneuver (r = 0.92) and the popliteal vein distensibility (r = 0.86). Variations in arterial inflow, venous outflow obstruction, or reflux did not affect the occlusion plethysmographic method. Plethysmographic changes related directly to venous volume changes, i.e. vein expansion suggesting that the pressure/volume relationship described vein compliance. CONCLUSION. The result show a direct relationship between the pressure/volume curve of the calf and deep vein distention. Shifts of the pressure/volume curve are likely to be mainly caused by vein wall changes, but other factors (e.g. condition of surrounding tissue, reduced venous volume) may also contribute and this needs further investigation.},

	Abstract = {The collection and processing of data from mechanical tests of biological tissues usually follow classical principles appropriate for studying engineering materials. However, difficulties specific to biological tissues have generally kept such methods from producing quantitative results for statistically-oriented studies. This paper demonstrates a different approach linking testing and data reduction with modern statistical tools. Experimental design theory is used to minimize the detrimental effects of collinearity on the stability of the parameters in constitutive equations. The numerical effects of time-dependent biasing factors such as viscoelasticity are reduced by randomizing the order of collection of data points. Some of the parameters of the model are allowed to vary from specimen to specimen while the others are computed once from a database of designed experiments on several specimens. Finally, a new self-modeling algorithm based on principal component analysis is used to generate uncorrelated parameters for a model that is linear in its specimen-dependent parameters. The method, associated with a recently published complementary energy formulation for vascular mechanics, is illustrated with biaxial canine saphenous vein data. Results show that three specimen-dependent linear parameters are enough to characterize the experimental data and that they can be repeatedly estimated from different data sets. Independently collected biaxial inflation data can also be predicted reasonably well with this model.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The durability of the variety of valve reconstruction techniques in "primary" reflux and postthrombotic reflux was studied. METHODS: A total of 423 valve repairs in 235 patients with a follow-up period ranging from 1 to 12 years were analyzed. End points for assessment consisted of ulcer recurrence and Doppler competence in serial duplex examination. Multivariate analysis with Cox proportional hazards model was used. RESULTS: Ulcer-free survival curves were similar for "primary" and postthrombotic reflux. No significant difference in ulcer recurrence was seen regardless of the technique used. Different results were obtained when valve competence instead of ulcer recurrence was used for assessment of durability. Reconstructions in "primary" reflux were more durable than those in postthrombotic reflux. Durability differences were also noted among different techniques. A cohort of posterior tibial repairs proved extraordinarily durable (0 failures in 23 repairs). CONCLUSION: Valve reconstruction in postthrombotic reflux can yield clinical results similar to those in "primary" reflux. Although any of the several described techniques can produce similar clinical results, Doppler competence suggests the following order for choice of procedures: (1) internal valvuloplasty, (2) prosthetic sleeve in situ, (3) external valvuloplasty, and (4) axillary vein transfer.},

The properties of specimens tested in their physiological range of loadings immediately after thawing were not significantly different from their properties before cryopreservation. However, they stiffened significantly in the few hours following thawing. This effect was not observed for aging fresh specimens, nor for cyanide-poisoned specimens, indicating that the static tone of the venous smooth muscle may be affected by cryopreservation and thawing, but the elastin and collagen fibers are most likely unaffected.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The results of saphenectomy in patients with morphologic and functional obstruction were compared with those in patients without obstruction. Excision of secondary saphenous varices associated with deep venous obstruction has long been considered contraindicated for fear of compromising its collateral contribution. Recent advances in accurate functional assessment of venous obstruction make it possible to test this concept. METHODS: Saphenectomy was carried out in 51 limbs without morphologic or functional obstruction and 64 limbs with varying grades of venous obstruction. Significant deep venous obstruction on ascending venography was present in the latter group. Functional assessment of obstruction was based on the arm/foot venous pressure differential technique, outflow fraction measurements, and outflow resistance calculations. Valve reconstruction was carried out in conjunction with saphenectomy in 81% of cases. RESULTS: Saphenectomy was clinically well tolerated in both groups, and there was no difference in outcome as measured by objective tests for obstruction; improvement in reflux and calf venous pump function was largely similar. Among seven limbs with severe preoperative venous obstruction (grade III or IV), five (70%) had significantly improved obstructive grading, presumably as a result of elimination of reflux flow. CONCLUSIONS: The traditional admonition against removal of secondary varices should be reexamined. Saphenectomy may be indicated in postthrombotic syndrome with mixed obstruction/reflux. The procedure is clinically well tolerated and without malsequelae. Improvement in reflux parameters without significant worsening of objective measures of obstruction is documented in this group.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To highlight a special subset of cases of venous stasis in which the profunda femoris vein enlarges to a variable extent (axial transformation) to compensate for severe postthrombotic changes in the accompanying superficial femoral vein. METHODS: Among 500 consecutively treated patients with severe venous stasis, 57 patients had axial transformation of the profunda femoris vein. Venous obstruction and reflux were assessed by means of arm-foot pressure differential, ambulatory venous pressure measurement, air plethysmography, and duplex examination. Ascending and descending venograms also were obtained. A variety of valve reconstruction techniques were useful in correcting reflux in the enlarged profunda femoris vein and the companion postthrombotic superficial femoral vein. RESULTS: In 55% of patients the profunda femoris vein was larger than normal and provided partial outflow from the leg through a profunda-popliteal connection, but the superficial femoral vein was still the dominant outflow tract (grades I and II). In 36% of patients the profunda femoris was the dominant outflow tract from the leg, and in another 9% it was the sole axial outflow tract (grades III and IV). The skin changes of advanced venous stasis were present among 92% of patients and frank ulceration among 88%. Antireflux operations on the profunda femoris vein and companion superficial femoral vein, including ligation and division in some instances, were well tolerated. Despite a postthrombotic cause, obstruction did not worsen after surgical treatment, and reflux improved according to most laboratory measurements. Complete ulcer healing was obtained with the surgical techniques described. The actuarial recurrence-free survival rates were 90% 1 year and 66% 5 years after treatment. CONCLUSION: Axial transformation of the profunda femoris vein is present in a subset of instances in which severe postthrombotic changes are present in the companion superficial femoral vein. Profunda femoris reflux is invariably present in these instances because of compensatory dilatation and enlargement of this vessel. Simultaneous valve repair of the axially transformed profunda femoris vein and companion superficial femoral vein to abolish reflux yields excellent long-term results and healing of stasis ulceration.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the role of valve closure and column segmentation in ambulatory venous pressure regulation. METHODS: Using a mechanical model consisting of a graduated adjustable valve and a collapsible tube, we studied the differential effects of valve closure and tube collapse on venous pressure regulation. By utilizing materials with differing wall properties for the infravalvular tube, the influence of wall property changes on tube function and pressure regulation was explored. RESULTS: Valve closure, per se, does not cause venous pressure reduction. Collapse of the tube below the valve is the primary pressure regulatory mechanism. The nonlinear volume-pressure relationship that exists in infravalvular tubes confers significant buffering properties to the collapsible tube, which tends to retain a near-constant pressure for a wide range of ejection fractions, residual tube volumes, and valve leaks. Changes in tube wall property affect this buffering action, at both the low and high ends of the physiological venous pressure range. CONCLUSIONS: The valve and the infravalvular venous segment should be considered together in venous pressure regulation. Tube collapse of the segment below the valve is the primary pressure regulatory mechanism. An understanding of the hydrodynamic principles involved in pressure regulation derived from this model will provide the basis for construction of more complex models to explore clinical physiology and dysfunction.},

	Abstract = {External pneumatic compression of the lower legs is effective as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis. In a typical application, inflatable cuffs are wrapped around the patient's legs and periodically inflated to prevent stasis, accelerate venous blood flow, and enhance fibrinolysis. The purpose of this study was to examine the stress distribution within the tissues, and the corresponding venous blood flow and intravascular shear stress with different external compression modalities. A two-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) was used to determine venous collapse as a function of internal (venous) pressure and the magnitude and spatial distribution of external (surface) pressure. Using the one-dimensional equations governing flow in a collapsible tube and the relations for venous collapse from the FEA, blood flow resulting from external compression was simulated. Tests were conducted to compare circumferentially symmetric (C) and asymmetric (A) compression and to examine distributions of pressure along the limb. Results show that A compression produces greater vessel collapse and generates larger blood flow velocities and shear stresses than C compression. The differences between axially uniform and graded-sequential compression are less marked than previously found, with uniform compression providing slightly greater peak flow velocities and shear stresses. The major advantage of graded-sequential compression is found at midcalf. Strains at the lumenal border are approximately 20 percent at an external pressure of 50 mmHg (6650 Pa) with all compression modalities.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: to explore the hydrodynamic mechanisms involved in the regulation of ambulatory venous pressure. DESIGN: an experimental model of calf venous pump was constructed with collapsible tubes and valves. MATERIAL: the model consisted of a conduit and a pump with an intervening competent valve. Another valve that could allow reflux into the pump was mounted above the pump. METHODS: conduit pressure and recovery times were monitored under conditions of different degrees of ejection fraction and reflux into the pump. Model variables included using poorly compliant tubes for the pump, the conduit and for both the pump and conduit. RESULTS: the latex tube exhibited a non-linear volume-pressure relationship and a bi-modal regimen of compliance. This bestowed pressure-buffering properties. Ambulatory venous hypertension resulted when reflux beyond buffering capacity occurred. Substituting less compliant PTFE for latex at the pump had a relatively minor effect on post-ejection pressure and recovery times. Using PTFE at the conduit had a profound but divergent effect on both of these parameters. Conduit capacitance reduction had a similar effect. CONCLUSION: conduit elastance plays a significant role in the regulation of ambulatory venous pressure in this experimental model. The hydrodynamic principles illustrated by the model may enhance our understanding of the human calf venous pump.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: This study assessed whether axillary vein transfer can be successfully performed in trabeculated veins and whether patients with this severe form of postthrombotic syndrome can be helped by an aggressive approach. METHODS: A total of 102 axillary vein transfer procedures were carried out in 83 limbs with trabeculated veins. More than one venous segment was repaired in 38 limbs with a second axillary valve in 19, and a different technique was used in the remainder. The superficial and deep femoral veins were the most common target sites. "Bench repair" of leaky axillary valves was performed before the transfer in 32 cases. Venous stasis dermatitis or ulceration was present in 90% of the limbs. The operability rate and chance of successful valve reconstruction was high, even in the presence of severe venographic appearance. RESULTS: The actuarial transplant patency rate was 83% at 10 years. The actuarial freedom from recurrent ulceration rate was more than 60% at 10 years, similar to the results obtained in a matched group of axillary vein transfers to nontrabeculated veins. Severe preoperative ambulatory venous hypertension (venous filling time [VFT] of less than 5 seconds), which was present in 67% of patients, did not adversely affect outcome, but short VFTs that persisted after surgery did. VFT and VFI90 (venous filling index, air plethysmography) improved after valve transfer. Swelling disappeared or was significantly reduced in 55% of patients (11 of 20 patients) who had moderate or severe preoperative swelling. In 82% of patients (31 of 37 patients) who had mild or no preoperative swelling, the swelling remained stable after surgery, and in 18% of patients (6 of 37 patients), it became worse. Pain was significantly diminished in 70% of patients; 23% of patients with severe pain had complete resolution. CONCLUSION: Axillary vein transfer, in combination with other antirefluxive procedures when indicated, is safe, effective, and durable in patients with trabeculated veins and severe forms of postthrombotic syndrome. It may be considered as an option when conservative therapy or other types of surgery fail.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that patients with unstable coronary syndromes show accentuated compensatory vessel enlargement compared with patients with stable angina, and that this may in part be related to increased coronary artery distensibility. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: In 23 patients with unstable coronary syndromes (10 with non-Q wave myocardial infarction and 13 with unstable angina), the culprit lesion was investigated by intravascular ultrasound before intervention. The vessel cross sectional area (VA), lumen area (LA), and plaque area (VA minus LA) were measured at end diastole and end systole at the lesion site and at the proximal and distal reference segments. Similar measurements were made in 23 patients with stable angina admitted during the same period and matched for age, sex, and target vessel. Calculations were made of remodelling index (VA at lesion site / VA at reference site), distensibility index ([(delta A/A)/delta P] x 10(3), where delta A is the luminal area change in systole and diastole and delta P the difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured at the tip of the guiding catheter during a cardiac cycle), and stiffness index beta ([ln(P(sys)/P(dias))]/(delta D/D), where P(sys) is systolic pressure, P(dias) is diastolic pressure, and delta D is the difference between systolic and diastolic lumen diameters). Positive remodelling was defined as when the VA at the lesion was > 1.05 times larger than at the proximal reference site, and negative remodelling when the VA at the lesion was < 0.95 of the reference site. RESULTS: Mean (SD) LA at the lesion site was similar in both groups (4.03 (1.8) v 4.01 (1. 93) mm(2)), while plaque area was larger in the unstable group (13. 29 (4.04) v 8.34 (3.6) mm(2), p < 0.001). Remodelling index was greater in the unstable group (1.14 (0.18) v 0.83 (0.15), p < 0.001). Positive remodelling was observed in 15 patients in the unstable group (65%) but in only two (9%) in the stable group (p < 0.001). Negative remodelling occurred only in two patients with unstable symptoms (9%) but in 17 (74%) with stable symptoms. At the proximal reference segment, the difference in LA between systole and diastole was 0.99 (0.66) mm(2) in the unstable group and 0.39 (0.3) mm(2) in the stable group (p < 0.001), and the calculated coronary artery distensibility was 3.09 (2.69) and 0.94 (0.83) per mm Hg in unstable and stable patients, respectively (p < 0.001). The stiffness index beta was lower in patients with unstable angina (1.95 (0.94) v 3.1 (0.96), p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compensatory vessel enlargement occurs to a greater degree in patients with unstable than with stable coronary syndromes, and is associated with increased coronary artery distensibility.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare the results and complications of endovascular surgery in limbs with post-thrombotic and non-thrombotic disease and to detail some technical aspects of the procedure. DESIGN: A single centre, prospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1997 and August 1999, 139 consecutive lower extremities with chronic iliac venous obstruction (61 limbs with primary disease [MTS] and 78 with post-thrombotic disease [PTS]) were treated by balloon dilation and stenting. History, clinical examination, procedure and follow-up data were recorded. RESULTS: Mortality was zero. Non-thrombotic complication rate was only 3%. Postoperative (8%, 6/78) and late occlusion (3%, 2/69) occurred only in post-thrombotic limbs. Primary, primary-assisted and secondary cumulative patency rates of the stented area at 2 years were 52%, 88% and 90%, respectively, in the PTS group as compared to 60%, 100% and 100% in the MTS group. Clinical improvement in pain and swelling was significant in both groups. Half of active venous ulcers healed after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic iliac vein obstruction appears to be a symptomatic lesion that can be treated safely and effectively by endovascular surgery regardless of aetiology. Generous use of IVUS is suggested in both diagnosis and treatment since phlebography is unreliable. The clinical improvement was significant in both groups; however, more excessive neointimal hyperplasia and a higher early and late occlusion rate were observed in post-thrombotic disease. Stenting after balloon dilation is advised in all venoplasties; stents should be inserted well into the IVC when treating iliocaval junction stenosis. A wide-diameter (16 mm) stent is recommended. The stent should cover the entire lesion as outlined by the IVUS.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among pressures obtained simultaneously in the popliteal, long saphenous, and dorsal foot veins. METHOD: Eight limbs were studied. One limb had an isolated popliteal vein reflux, and two had moderate long saphenous vein incompetence. No perforator or short saphenous vein insufficiency was detected. Pressures and recovery times of the popliteal/tibial and long saphenous veins were obtained with cannulation at the ankle level and insertion of catheters with a pressure transducer tip. The dorsal foot vein pressure was measured with the insertion of a scalp needle (14-gauge) connected to an external transducer. During 10 toe stands, recordings were simultaneously made in the three veins at the level of the knee joint, in the middle third of the calf, and 5 to 7 cm above the ankle with all the transducers at the same level (ie, same reference point). RESULTS: In one limb the popliteal/tibial pressure increased at all calf levels, whereas pressures decreased in both saphenous and dorsal foot veins. The pressures decreased in all three systems in the remaining seven limbs. There was no statistical difference between the pressure drop in the long saphenous vein and the deep vein. However, the decrease of the dorsal foot venous pressure was significantly more marked compared with the other two veins at all levels. The recovery time was significantly increased in the long saphenous vein compared with the deep vein; recovery time was further prolonged in the dorsal foot vein. CONCLUSION: The dorsal foot, long saphenous, and popliteal/posterior tibial veins clearly exhibit different pressure waveforms in response to calf exercise. The postexercise pressure, the percentage pressure drop, and the recovery times are widely different, which indicates that the three veins behave hydraulically as separate compartments in limbs without significant venous insufficiency.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe a method for measuring the deep venous pressure changes in the lower extremity and compare it with those obtained in the dorsal foot vein. METHODS: After cannulation of the posterior tibial vein, a catheter with a pressure transducer in its tip was inserted and placed at the knee joint level. The dorsal foot vein was also cannulated. Pressures were recorded simultaneously at both sites during toe stands and repeated with the probe in the upper, middle, and lower calf. RESULTS: The study was performed in 45 patients with signs and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency. Duplex Doppler scanning and ascending and descending venography performed before pressure measurements revealed saphenous vein incompetence in 11 lower extremities, incompetent perforators in 11 extremities (eight were combined with saphenous incompetence), and marked compression of popliteal vein with plantar flexion in 28 extremities. No significant deep axial reflux was observed on duplex Doppler examination or descending venography. No morphologic outflow obstruction was detected. The mean deep pressure at the knee joint level fell during toe stands, -15% +/- 27 (SD), and the mean dorsal foot vein pressure drop was even more marked, -75% +/- 22 (SD). Although the exercise pressure in the dorsal foot vein decreased in all patients (range, 13-90% drop), the popliteal vein pressure increased (4-72%) in nine limbs, decreased only marginally if at all in 15 limbs (0-15%), and fell more markedly in 21 extremities (22-65%). Deep vein recovery time was considerably shorter overall as compared with the findings by the dorsal vein measurement. In the comparison of limbs with and without superficial reflux, the recovery times in the deep system were significantly shorter in limbs with superficial incompetence. CONCLUSION: Ambulatory dorsal foot venous pressure is not always accurate in detecting changes in the pressure of the tibial and popliteal veins. Although dorsal foot venous pressure may be normal, deep venous pressure may decrease to a lesser degree or even increase.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe the technical aspects of percutaneous balloon dilation and stenting for the treatment of venous outflow obstruction in chronic venous insufficiency. METHODS: Between March 1997 and December 1998, 94 consecutive patients (median age 48 years, range 14 to 80) with suspected iliac vein obstruction in 102 limbs were studied prospectively with the intent to treat any venous occlusion or stenosis verified during femoral vein cannulation. Data from the history, clinical examination, procedure, and follow-up were recorded. Preoperative indicators of obstruction were venographic evidence of occlusion, stenosis, or pelvic collateral vessels; increased arm-foot venous pressure differential; and abnormal hyperemia-induced venous pressure elevation. RESULTS: Cannulation and technical success rates were 98% and 97%, respectively, with 118 Wallstents deployed in 77 veins. Primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates at 1 year were 82%, 91%, and 92%, respectively. Clinical improvement in pain and swelling was significant. CONCLUSIONS: Stenting of benign iliac vein obstruction is a safe method with good short-term results. Venous lesions should always be stented; when treating iliocaval junction lesions, stents should be inserted well into the inferior vena cava. Absence of collateral vessels does not exclude the existence of significant obstruction, and their presence may indicate an obstruction not visualized. No gold standard for accurate pre- or intraoperative patient selection is currently available.},

	Abstract = {This consensus document provides an up-to-date account of the various methods available for the investigation of chronic venous insufficiency of the lower limbs (CVI), with an outline of their history, usefulness, and limitations. CVI is characterized by symptoms or signs produced by venous hypertension as a result of structural or functional abnormalities of veins. The most frequent causes of CVI are primary abnormalities of the venous wall and the valves and secondary changes due to previous venous thrombosis that can lead to reflux, obstruction, or both. Because the history and clinical examination will not always indicate the nature and extent of the underlying abnormality (anatomic extent, pathology, and cause), a number of diagnostic investigations have been developed that can elucidate whether there is calf muscle pump dysfunction and determine the anatomic extent and severity of obstruction or reflux. The difficulty in deciding which investigations to use and how to interpret the results has stimulated the development of this consensus document. The aim of this document was to provide an account of these tests, with an outline of their usefulness and limitations and indications of which patients should be subjected to the tests and when and of what clinical decisions can be made. This document was written primarily for the clinician who would like to learn the latest approaches to the investigation of patients with CVI and the new applications that have emerged from recent research, as well as for the novice who is embarking on venous research. Care has been taken to indicate which methods have entered the clinical arena and which are mainly used for research. The foundation for this consensus document was laid by the faculty at a meeting held under the auspices of the American Venous Forum, the Cardiovascular Disease Educational and Research Trust, the European Society of Vascular Surgery, the International Angiology Scientific Activity Congress Organization, the International Union of Angiology, and the Union Internationale de Phlebologie at the Abbaye des Vaux de Cernay, France, on March 5 to 9, 1997. Subsequent input by co-opted faculty members and revisions in 1998 and 1999 have ensured a document that provides an up-to-date account of the various methods available for the investigation of CVI.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the technique of a variation of closed external venous valve repair (transcommissural valvuloplasty), its complication rate, and duplex scan durability. METHODS: The "blind" transcommissural valve repair of the vein was performed by placing transluminal sutures along the valve attachment lines, which simultaneously closed the valve attachment angle and also tightened the valve cusps. A total of 179 successfully repaired valve sites of 141 limbs in 129 patients were followed up 1 to 42 months through clinical observation and with duplex Doppler ultrasound scan. RESULTS: Postoperative complications (< 30 days) occurred in 12 (9%) of 141 limbs: superficial (1) and deep (1) wound infection, large wound hematoma (4), seroma (1), and deep vein thrombosis (5), with associated pulmonary embolus in one patient. Seventy-eight percent (reflux time </= 0.5 seconds) and 81% (reflux time </= 1.0 seconds) of valve sites were competent. The cumulative competency rate at 30 months was 59% and 63%, respectively. The cumulative ulcer recurrence-free interval was 63% at 30 months (n = 92). The pain score and swelling grade substantially improved. CONCLUSION: Transcommissural valvuloplasty is a safe procedure with low morbidity. It is relatively rapid and simple to perform, and its competency rates are comparable to those of internal valvuloplasty. Advantages over the internal repair are that venotomy is not required, repair can be extended to small-caliber veins, and multiple valve stations can be repaired in a single stage.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to analyze valve station changes noted during venous valve reconstruction and the associated outcome. One hundred and forty-nine valve reconstructions were available for analysis at the time of surgical exploration; the venous valve was graded according to valve station changes (VS grades) from zero through six. Ascending venography was analyzed by a similar grading system and the two methods were compared. The results of this analysis showed that valve station wall changes are frequently present in patients with deep venous reflux and pose technical challenges during valve reconstruction; the outcome, however, appears unaffected. Grade 0 to 1 valve station changes are predominantly due to "primary" reflux, with an occasional instance of postthrombotic etiology. Grade 2 or 3 valve station changes are roughly evenly divided between phlebosclerosis of primary reflux and postthrombotic etiologies. The mechanism of onset of reflux with preservation of valve cusps in the latter group of postthrombotic cases is probably different from currently accepted theories of evolution of postthrombotic changes. Postthrombotic valve damage is variable, and the valve station anatomy may be sufficiently preserved in some patients to allow direct valve repair.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Asymptomatic morphologic popliteal vein entrapment is frequently found in the healthy population (27%). In our institution, popliteal vein compression on plantar flexion was observed in 42% of all ascending venograms. Some authorities consider the lesion benign, without pathologic significance. This study examines the pathophysiologic importance in select patients, describes treatment with surgery, and suggests a diagnostic tool. METHOD: Thirty severely symptomatic patients with venographic evidence of popliteal entrapment were selected to have popliteal vein release after a process of elimination (ie, other causes of chronic venous insufficiency [CVI] were ruled out by means of comprehensive hemodynamic and morphologic studies). In the last nine limbs, popliteal vein pressure was also measured by means of the introduction of a 2F transducer tip catheter. Patients were clinically and hemodynamically assessed before and after surgery, and anatomical anomalies encountered during surgery were recorded. RESULTS: Popliteal vein release was performed without mortality or serious morbidity. Anomalies of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle caused entrapment in 60% of the patients; anatomic course venous anomalies were infrequent (7% of the patients). Significant relief of pain and swelling occurred in the patients who had surgery. Stasis ulceration/dermatitis resolved in 82% of patients. Popliteal venous pressures had normalized in the six patients who were studied postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Popliteal vein entrapment should be included in the differential diagnosis of CVI in patients in whom other, more common etiologies have been excluded on the basis of comprehensive investigations. Popliteal vein compression can be demonstrated venographically in a large proportion of patients with CVI, but the lesion is likely pathological only in a small fraction of these patients. A technique for popliteal venous pressure measurement is described; it shows promise as a test for functional assessment of entrapment. Immediate results of popliteal vein release surgery are encouraging; long-term follow-up is necessary to judge the efficacy of surgical lysis of entrapment in symptomatic patients who fail to improve with conservative treatment measures.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report improvement or normalization of abnormal lymphoscintigraphy in swollen lower limbs after correction of associated venous stenosis by balloon dilatation and placement of venous stent of the iliac veins. MATERIAL: Twenty-six patients with lower-limb swelling underwent balloon dilatation and placement of venous stent of the iliac veins for correction of venous stenosis. Technetium 99M-sulfur colloid lymphoscintigraphy was also abnormal (8 absent, 18 reduced) before stent placement in all 26 limbs, suggesting combined venous/lymphatic etiology for the limb swelling. Median age was 53 years. Male-to-female ratio was 1:8 and left-to-right ratio, 3:1. Fifteen patients had limb pain associated with the swelling. Severity of venous stenosis was generally underestimated by preoperative transfemoral venography as compared with intravascular ultrasound, (mean, 50% versus 77%); in five limbs (19%), transfemoral venography altogether failed to identify the venous lesion evident on intravascular ultrasound. The etiology of venous obstruction was post-thrombotic in nine limbs and nonthrombotic (web, stricture, or May-Thurner syndrome) in 17 limbs. RESULTS: Poststent lymphoscintigraphy completely normalized in 10 limbs, improved but remained abnormal in 9, and remained unchanged in 7. Clinical follow-up (mean, 1 year) showed improvement in swelling in 16 of 26 limbs (P <.022), with complete resolution of swelling in six; degree of pain also improved (P <.02), with total relief of pain in 9 of 15 patients. There was also significant improvement in all categories of a quality of life questionnaire. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that patients with a diagnosis of lymphedema made on the basis of lymphoscintigraphy alone and consigned to conservative therapy on that basis may benefit from additional venous investigations regardless of clinical presentation suggestive of lymphedema. This report supports the practice of aggressively searching for a venous basis of edema in these patients. Correction of the venous lesion may result in normalization or improvement of the lymphoscintigraphic abnormality and in any case may yield significant symptom relief, even in some limbs where the lymphoscintigraphic abnormality failed to improve after placement of venous stent.},

	Abstract = {There have been a disturbing number of unexpected mechanical failures in deployed vascular stents and stent grafts. An analysis of the mechanical properties of mock arteries used to carry out standard durability testing on the aforementioned medical products suggests that some of the problems might be related to a frequency dependent change in the properties of these recipient vessels. This could lead to a lower than expected level of loading and an attendant reduction in severity of testing. A clear understanding of how a pulsating artery cyclically loads a deployed stent is important before a mock artery can be designed to carry out biologically relevant in vitro durability testing. In addition, knowledge of the time dependent response of both the vessel and the stent/stent graft is critical before any accelerated testing protocol can be properly designed. This paper will present an analysis of the loading on a stent versus pressure and diameter of the recipient vessel and how this varies with frequency. Actual compliance versus frequency data will be used from silicone mock arteries.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was the comparison of intravascular ultrasound scanning (IVUS) with transfemoral venography in the assessment of chronic iliac vein obstruction. METHODS: IVUS and standard, single-plane, transfemoral venography were performed in 304 consecutive limbs during balloon dilation and stenting of an obstructed iliac venous segment. The appearance of the obstruction was described, and the degree of stenosis (maximal diameter reduction) was estimated with venography and IVUS. The stenotic area was derived with diameter calculations (pir(2)) and also was measured with the built-in software of the IVUS apparatus before and after dilation and stenting in 173 limbs. Preoperative hand/foot differential pressure and preoperative dorsal foot venous and intraoperative transfemoral hyperemia-induced pressure elevations after intra-arterial injection of papaverine hydrochloride were measured. RESULTS: With IVUS, fine intraluminal and mural details were detected (eg, trabeculation, frozen valves, mural thickness, and outside compression) that were not seen with venography. The median stenosis (with diameter reduction) on venographic results was 50% (range, 0 to 100%) and on IVUS results was 80% (range, 25% to 100%). In a comparison with IVUS as the standard, venography had poor sensitivity (45%) and negative predictive value (49%) in the detection of a venous area stenosis of >70%. The actual stenotic area was more severe when measured directly with IVUS (0.31 cm(2); range, 0 to 1.68 cm(2)) versus derived (0.36 cm(2); range, 0 to 3.08 cm(2); P <.001), probably as a result of the noncircular lumen geometry of the stenosis. No correlation was found between any of the preoperative or intraoperative pressure measurements and degree of stenosis with or without collaterals. When collaterals were present, a more severe stenosis (median, 85%; range, 25% to 100%) was observed (versus a 70% stenosis in the absence of collaterals; range, 30% to 99%; P <.001), along with actual stenotic area (with collaterals: median, 0.24 cm(2); range, 0 to 1.18 cm(2); without collaterals: median, 0.45 cm(2); range, 0.02 to 1.68 cm(2); P <.01) and a higher rate of hyperemia-induced pressure gradient (> or =2 mm Hg; with collaterals, 34%; without collaterals, 11%; P <.05). CONCLUSION: Venous IVUS appears to be superior to single-plane venography for the morphologic diagnosis of iliac venous outflow obstruction and is an invaluable assistance in the accurate placement of venous stents after venoplasty. No preoperative or intraoperative pressure test appears to adequately measure the hemodynamic significance of the stenosis. In lieu of adequate hemodynamic tests, IVUS determination of morphologically significant stenosis appears to be presently the best available method for the diagnosis of clinically important chronic iliac vein obstruction. Collateral formation should perhaps be looked on as an indicator of a more severe stenosis, although significant obstruction may exist with no collateral formation.},

	Abstract = {As postthrombotic disease becomes better understood, the importance of venous outflow obstruction is recognized increasingly. It appears that obstruction of the iliac vein is particularly important and results in more severe symptoms than more distal segmental blockages. Unfortunately, no accurate invasive or noninvasive test for the evaluation of obstruction is available. In fact, it is not known what degree of venous stenosis should be considered hemodynamically "critical." Thus, currently it is impossible to detect borderline obstructions of potential hemodynamic significance. A high index of suspicion must be maintained. The diagnosis relies on clinical signs and symptoms, and treatment must be based on results of morphologic investigations such as transfemoral phlebography or, preferably, intravascular ultrasonography. Percutaneous iliac venous balloon dilation and insertion of a stent offers a safe and efficient method to correct pelvic venous obstruction. It is less invasive and relatively safer than open surgery and can, therefore, be offered to a larger group of patients. Furthermore, initial percutaneous management does not preclude subsequent bypass or reflux surgery. Although the technique is recent and follow-up relatively short, there is cautious optimism that this treatment will be useful and replace bypass surgery for iliac venous obstruction.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report our experience with percutaneous recanalization of totally occluded iliac veins and inferior vena cava. Material and Methods: Recanalization of the iliac vein was performed in 38 limbs. In nine limbs, recanalization of the inferior vena cava was also necessary (two with filter). In 28 of 38 limbs, the stent was extended below the groin crease into the common femoral vein segment. Large-caliber (14 or 16 mm for iliac vein) flexible self-expanding stents were used. Stents were routinely extended for a short distance into the inferior vena cava to forestall development of iliocaval stenosis. Intravascular ultrasound scan was a valuable tool in the procedure. The median length of the recanalized segment was long (22 cm), and multiple stents (median, n = 3) were necessary in most patients. Forty-five percent of the patients had coagulation abnormalities. RESULTS: No morbidity or mortality was seen. Actuarial primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency rates of the stents at 24 months were 49%, 62%, and 76%, respectively. Median pain level decreased significantly (level 4 to level 0; P <.0001) after stent placement, and more than two thirds of the patients became totally pain free after the procedure. Swelling also improved significantly, and a third of the patients became totally free of any swelling after stent placement. Sixty-six percent of cases with stasis ulcers/dermatitis (n = 14) were resolved (actuarial, 1 year), although uncorrected reflux persisted in many of these limbs. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous recanalization of the occluded iliac vein with stent placement appears to be successful in the short term, with good patency, significant symptom resolution, and minimal morbidity.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was the presentation of the results of iliac venous stent placement in the management of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). METHODS: Balloon dilation and stent placement for the relief of iliac vein stenoses was performed in 304 limbs with symptomatic CVI. Sixty-one limbs had concomitant saphenous vein ablation. The median age was 52 years (range, 14 to 83 years). The ratio of postthrombotic to nonthrombotic CVI was 1 to 0.9. The CEAP classification clinical scores were: C(2), 24; C(3), 158; C(4), 60; C(5), 13; and C(6), 49. Associated reflux was present in 57% of the limbs. The procedure was performed on an outpatient basis. Intravascular ultrasound scanning was routinely performed because transfemoral venography had poor sensitivity for the detection of iliac vein stenosis. RESULTS: The actuarial primary and secondary stent patency rates at 24 months were 71% and 90%, respectively. The median degree of swelling (graded 0 to 3, for none, pitting, ankle edema, to gross leg edema) declined from grade 2 to grade 1 after surgery (P <.001). The limbs without any swelling increased from 12% before stenting to 47% after stenting (P <.01). The pain level recorded on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10 declined from a median level of 4 to 0 after stent placement (P <.001). The limbs that were completely free of pain increased from 17% before stenting to 71% after stent placement (P <.001). Stasis dermatitis/ulceration was present in 69 limbs. The improvement in swelling and pain was similar in ulcerated and nonulcerated limbs. The cumulative recurrence-free ulcer healing rate was 62% at 24 months. The rate of ulcer healing was similar whether or not concomitant saphenous ablation was performed. Quality of life has significantly improved. CONCLUSION: The correction of iliac vein outflow obstruction with the placement of stents results in the significant relief of major symptoms of CVI. The procedure is minimally invasive, can be performed on an outpatient basis, has minimal complications with a high patency rate, and does not preclude subsequent open surgery for the correction of restenosis or the associated reflux. If these preliminary results are sustained for a long-term period, stent placement for the correction of iliac vein stenoses may represent a useful advance in the management of CVI.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary stent deployment is associated with a low incidence of acute thrombosis. However, late stent thrombosis (LST) has likely been underrecognized clinically, and pathological descriptions are lacking. METHODS AND RESULTS: LST was defined as an acute thrombus within a stent that had been in place > or =30 days. Cases of LST were selected from a registry of human coronary stents submitted for analysis. Thirteen cases of LST (9 men, 4 women) were identified. The mean duration from implantation to thrombosis was 3.6+/-3.5 months (range, 1 to 11.9 months). The causes of death were sudden cardiac death (n=10), acute myocardial infarction (n=2), and heart failure (n=1). The pathological mechanisms of LST were as follows: (1) stenting across ostia of major arterial branches (5 cases); (2) exposure to radiation therapy (3 cases); (3) plaque disruption in the nonstented arterial segment within 2 mm of the stent margin (2 cases); (4) stenting of markedly necrotic, lipid-rich plaques with extensive plaque prolapse (2 cases); and (5) diffuse in-stent restenosis (1 case). Twelve cases demonstrated a failure to form a completely healed neointimal layer overlying stent struts. Underlying in-stent restenosis was present in only 4 (31%) of 13 cases. CONCLUSIONS: LST is a potentially fatal complication of coronary stenting. Stenting across branch ostia, disruption of adjacent vulnerable plaques, radiation therapy, and extensive plaque prolapse can precipitate LST. Impaired intimal healing (ie, the failure to form a complete neointimal layer over stent struts) extends the window during which stents are prone to thrombosis.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immediate and short-term outcome of inserted cryopreserved vein valve allografts and the clinical outcome of treated limbs. METHOD: Twenty-seven cryovalves were inserted in 25 postthrombotic limbs because of active leg ulcer (20 limbs) or severe disabling leg pain (five limbs) as a procedure of last resort. Previous venous surgery had been performed in 80% of the limbs. Main stem superficial reflux and iliac venous outflow obstruction were controlled before cryovalve insertion. The most common insertion site was the superficial femoral or popliteal vein. Patients were followed up with clinical examination and with intermittent duplex Doppler scanning or ascending venography to assess patency and competency of the valve station. RESULTS: After thawing, but before insertion, 74% of the cryovalves were incompetent and needed repair with transcommissural valvuloplasty. After insertion, mortality was zero. Morbidity was 48%, mainly because of seroma formation and deep wound infection. One cryovalve was explanted because of acute rejection. Six cryovalves occluded early (<6 weeks), and five occluded late. Cumulative rates of patent cryovalves and both patent and competent cryovalves at 24-month follow-up were 41% and 27%, respectively. Cumulative ulcer recurrence-free rate at 36 months was 50%. Pain relief was poor, and degree of swelling remained the same. CONCLUSION: Compared with autologous vein transfer, cryovalve insertion is associated with high morbidity, high occlusion rate, poor cumulative midterm rate of patent graft with competent valve, and poor clinical results. The procedure should not be used as a primary technique for valve reconstruction, and it is questionable whether it is useful even in patients in whom autologous reconstruction techniques have been exhausted. The basis of the high failure rate is unclear; it may be immunologic or due to loss of endothelial cover after implantation. If cryovalves are to be a viable valve repair alternative, improved cryopreservation technique, immunologic modifications, or better matching must be achieved.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the importance of iliac venous outflow obstruction in limbs with and without concomitant deep or superficial reflux, we performed a retrospective analysis of data contemporaneously entered into a set time-stamped electronic medical records program. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Four hundred forty-seven limbs underwent iliac vein stenting of chronic, nonmalignant obstruction when greater than 50% morphologic stenosis was found at transfemoral venography or intravascular ultrasonography. Group 1 (female-male ratio, 3.4:1; left limb-right limb, 2.7:1; nonthrombotic-thrombotic, 1.8:1) included 187 stented limbs in 176 patients with absence of deep and superficial reflux as identified at erect duplex Doppler scanning. Group 2 (female-male, 1.7:1; left-right, 1.9:1, nonthrombotic-thrombotic limb, 1:2.1) included 260 limbs in 253 patients with combination obstruction and reflux. Reflux was left untreated during the observation period. Clinical outcome (ulcer healing and recurrence rate, degree of pain per visual analog scale, swelling grade) and hemodynamic effects (ambulatory venous pressure, venous refilling time, venous filling index at 90 seconds) of iliac venous stenting were assessed. RESULT: Patients with reflux and obstruction had more severe disease (clinical class 4-6, 53% in group 2 vs 24% in group 1; P <.001). Similarly, rate of active ulcer was low in limbs with obstruction only (3% vs 24%, groups 1 and 2, respectively). Mean clinical follow-up was 13 +/- 12 months (SD) in 86% of limbs. Because of the presence of reflux in group 2, venous pressure was higher, venous filling time was shorter, and venous filling index at 90 seconds increased, compared with group 1. Multisegment scores were 2.6 +/- 1.6 and 0, respectively. Of greater interest, there was no deterioration in venous hemodynamics in group 2 after stenting. There was substantial clinical improvement in both groups after stenting. Approximately half of patients were completely relieved of pain after stenting, and a third were completely relieved of swelling. In addition, 55% of ulcerated limbs healed. CONCLUSION: Iliac venous outflow obstruction appears to have an important role in clinical expression of chronic venous insufficiency, particularly in producing pain, and is easily overlooked, mainly because of diagnostic difficulty. The combination of reflux and obstruction is seen more frequently with severe clinical disease than is obstruction alone. Ulcer prevalence is clearly associated with reflux, with a low incidence in patients with obstruction alone. Removal of iliac vein outflow obstruction does not result in increased axial reflux, with clinical deterioration in limbs with combined reflux and obstruction.},

	Abstract = {The effectiveness of a cardiovascular stent depends on many factors, such as its ability to sustain the compression applied by the vessel wall, minimal longitudinal contraction when it is expanded, and its ability to flex when navigating tortuous blood vessels. The long-term reaction of the tissue to the stent is also device dependant; in particular some designs provoke in-stent restenosis (i.e., regrowth of the occlusion around the stent). The mechanism of restenosis is thought to involve injury or damage to the vessel wall due to the high stresses generated around the stent when it expands. Because of this, the deflection of the tissue between the struts of the stent (called prolapse or "draping") has been used as a measure of the potential of a stent to cause restenosis. In this paper, uniaxial and biaxial experiments on human femoral artery and porcine aortic vascular tissue are used to develop a hyperelastic constitive model of vascular tissue suitable for implementation in finite-element analysis. To analyze prolapse, four stent designs (BeStent 2, Medtronic AVE; NIROYAL, Boston Scientific; VELOCITY, Cordis; TETRA, Guidant) were expanded in vitro to determine their repeating-unit dimensions. This geometric data was used to generate a finite element model of the vascular tissue supported within a repeating-unit of the stent. Under a pressure of 450 mm Hg (representing the radial compression of the vessel wall), maximum radial deflection of 0.253 mm, 0.279 mm, 0.348 mm and 0.48 mm were calculated for each of the four stents.

	Abstract = {Acute complications of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities include pulmonary embolism and venous ischemia. Delayed complications include a spectrum of debilitating symptoms referred to as postthrombotic syndrome (PST). Anticoagulation therapy is recognized as the mainstay of therapy in acute DVT. However, there are few data to suggest any major beneficial effect on PTS, which is thought to be mediated by valve damage and/or occlusive chronic thrombus and venous scarring. Endovascular catheter-directed thrombolysis techniques with pharmacologic thrombolytic agents, used alone or in combination with mechanical thrombectomy devices, have been proven highly effective in clearing acute DVT, which may allow the preservation of venous valve function and prevention of subsequent venous occlusive disease. Definitive management of underlying anatomic occlusive abnormalities can also be undertaken.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Compliance of artificial and autologous vascular grafts is related to future patency. We investigated whether differences in compliance exist between saphenous vein grafts derived from the upper or lower leg, which might indicate upper or lower leg saphenous vein preference in coronary artery bypass surgery. Furthermore, the effect of perivenous application of fibrin glue on mechanical vein wall properties was studied to evaluate its possible use as perivenous graft support. METHODS: Vein segments (N = 10) from upper or lower leg saphenous vein grafts were collected for histopathologic examination and smooth muscle cell/extracellular matrix (SMC/ECM) ratio was calculated. This ratio is suggested to be related with vascular elastic compliance. In a second group vein graft segments (N = 6) from upper and lower leg were placed in an in vitro model generating stepwise increasing static pressure up to 150 cm H(2)O. Outer diameter was measured continuously with a video micrometer system. Distensibility was calculated from the pressure-diameter curves. A third group of vein graft segments (N = 7) was pressurized after fibrin glue application to prevent overdistension, and studied in the same setup. RESULTS: Vein segments from the lower leg demonstrated a consistent higher relative response compared with the upper leg saphenous vein graft (0.9176 +/- 0.03993 vs 0.5245 +/- 0.02512). Both reach a plateau in the high-pressure range (> 100 cm H(2)O). A significant difference in in vitro distensibility between upper and lower leg saphenous vein was only found at a pressure of 50 cm H(2)O (p < 0.05). With fibrin glue, support overdistension is prevented as revealed by the maximum relative response between fibrin glue supported upper and lower leg saphenous vein segments (0.4080 +/- 0.02464 vs 0.582 +/- 0.051), and no plateau is reached in the pressure range up to 150 cm H(2)O. CONCLUSIONS: No upper or lower leg saphenous vein preference could be deduced from the differences in pressure-diameter response due to loss of distensibility (and thus of compliance) in the high-pressure range. Fibrin glue effectively prevents overdistension and preserves some distensibility in the high-pressure range in both the upper and lower leg saphenous vein. This might provide a basis for clinical application of perivenous support.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to assess which ultrasound-derived parameter was superior for measuring venous reflux quantitatively and to evaluate the importance of popliteal vein valve reflux. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of 244 refluxive limbs in 182 patients who underwent ultrasound scanning, venous pressure measurement, air plethysmography, and clinical classification of severity according to the CEAP score. Reflux time (RT, s), peak reflux velocity (PRV, m/s), time of average rate of reflux (TAF, mL/min), absolute displaced volume retrogradely (ADV, mL) were compared to clinical class, ambulatory venous pressure (% drop), venous filling time (s), and venous filling index (mL/s) using nonparametric statistical tests. A P value of <.05 was considered significant. Limbs were divided into 3 groups: (A) axial great saphenous vein reflux only (n = 68); (B) axial deep reflux including popliteal vein incompetence with or without concomitant gastrocnemius or great or small saphenous vein reflux (all ultrasound reflux parameters of each refluxive vein added at the knee level) (n = 79); and (C) all limbs with popliteal vein reflux (the ultrasound data of the refluxive popliteal vein exclusively was used in comparison regardless of concomitant associated reflux) (n = 103). Limbs were also stratified into limbs with skin changes and ulcer (C-class 4-6) and those without (C-class 1-3) and subsequently compared. RESULTS: No meaningful significant correlation was found between RT and the clinical and hemodynamic results in groups A and B. The PRV and TAF correlated significantly with the hemodynamic parameters. The PRV and TAF and clinical severity trended towards correlation in group A (P =.0554 and P =.0998, respectively), but was significantly correlated in group B. The poor hemodynamic condition in the subset of C-class 4-6 limbs in groups A and B was reflected in a greater PRV, TAF, and ADV in this subset as compared with the limbs in C-class 1-3. RT was not significantly different in the subsets of limbs, further suggesting that RT is not related to hemodynamic or clinical state of the limbs. No meaningful correlations were found in group C. Although the hemodynamic data were significantly poorer in the subset of limbs with C-class 4-6 than in C-class 1-3, the ultrasound-derived parameters were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: The duration of valve reflux time (or valve closure time) cannot be used to quantify severity of reflux and is purely a qualitative measurement. The PRV and the rate of reflux appeared to better reflect the magnitude of venous incompetence. In the presence of axial reflux, it appeared logical and physiologically correct to sum up these reflux parameters for each venous segment crossing the knee. The popliteal valve reflux (the "gatekeeper" function) was not in itself an important determinant of venous hemodynamics and clinical severity. Additional reflux in other venous segments must be taken into account.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to describe development of in-stent recurrent stenosis (ISR) in stents placed in the iliocaval outflow tract and to examine possible contributing factors. METHOD: After iliocaval balloon angioplasty and stent insertion to treat chronic nonmalignant obstruction, single-plane transfemoral venography was performed at least once in 324 limbs, twice in 123 limbs, three times in 40 limbs, and four times in 4 limbs. ISR was measured with a caliper, and expressed as percentage diameter reduction of patent lumen on the venograms. Left-right limb ratio was 2.3:1; thrombotic-nonthrombotic disease ratio, 1.2:1; negative-positive thrombophilia test ratio, 1.6:1; and above-below inguinal ligament stent placement ratio, 4.5:1. Median stent length was 9 cm (range, 4-35 cm), and median lumen area before and after stenting was 0.41 cm(2) (range, 0-1.65 cm(2)) and 1.70 cm(2) (range, 0.65-4.00 cm(2)), respectively. Limbs were divided into groups with no ISR, any degree of ISR, greater than 20% diameter reduction, and greater than 50% diameter reduction. Cumulative ISR and patency rates were analyzed. Possible contributing factors were examined. RESULTS: At 42 months, only 23% of limbs demonstrated no ISR. Cumulative rate of limbs with greater than 20% diameter reduction was 61%, and of limbs with greater than 50% diameter reduction was 15%. Patient gender or sidedness of the treated extremity did not affect outcome. At 36 months, limbs with thrombotic disease had higher ISR rates than did limbs without thrombotic disease (63% and 41% of limbs with >20% narrowing, and 23% and 4% of limbs with >50% narrowing, respectively; P <.01). Similarly, higher rates of ISR were found in patients with thrombophilia and long stents extending below the inguinal ligament. Primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates for the entire population at 3 years were 75%, 92%, and 93%, respectively. There was a significant increase in ISR in individual limbs, but analysis of groups of stents did not unequivocally show progression. CONCLUSION: Severe (>50%) ISR of iliofemoral venous stents is uncommon over the short term. The three major risk factors appear to be presence of thrombotic disease, positive thrombophilia test results, and stent extending below the inguinal ligament (long stents). Although stented limbs that eventually became occluded during the study demonstrated similar risk factors, no conclusion regarding a cause-effect relationship can be drawn from the present data. Whether late occlusion is due to acute thrombosis or to gradual development of true intimal hyperplasia requires further study.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There are wide differences in flow between vascular beds at rest, even more during stress. The hydrodynamic energy (Energy grade line or EGL) of venous outflows must also vary considerably between vascular beds. We explored the mechanism of venous admixture of differing energy flows using a mechanical model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The model simulated two venous flows coalescing at a venous junction and then flowing through collapsible venous pumps. Flow rates and pressures were monitored when the venous pumps were full (steady state) and when they were compressed and allowed to refill inducing wall motion (pump flow). RESULTS: With increasing EGL differences between two coalescing venous flows, reduction or cessation (venous flow restriction) of the weaker flow occurred during steady state; higher base EGL of both flows ameliorated venous flow restriction and lower base EGL the opposite. Outflow obstruction favoured venous flow restriction. Pump action in the vicinity of the venous junction abolished venous flow restriction and maximized both venous flows. CONCLUSION: The model suggests a pivotal role for vein wall motion in venous admixture and regional perfusion. Observations in the model are explained on the basis of network flow principles and collapsible tube mechanics.},

	Abstract = {New technology is transforming our approach to venous disease. Once considered taboo for fear of causing deep venous thrombosis, surgical or endovenous intervention in the deep venous system is now known to be safe. Newer techniques allow minimally invasive procedures, many carried out on an outpatient basis. Traditional conservative regimens to treat acute ilio-femoral DVT are yielding to more aggressive interventional approaches to minimize the high incidence of postthrombotic syndrome with the former. Stent technology can safely and effectively relieve many of the disabling symptoms of chronic venous obstruction. Stent patency is high and morbidity low. Knowledge of venous pathophysiology has also advanced, though much remains to be learned. The beneficiaries are the large patient population with DVT and chronic venous insufficiency, which is estimated to be at least three times as large as patients with arterial disease. Unlike arterial disease, venous pathology afflicts the younger working age population in large numbers at enormous direct and social costs. In the older patient, deep venous disease is common, but seldom suspected. The symptoms are often ascribed to systemic causes. A thorough venous investigation is the key to proper diagnosis and treatment. Often, a minimally invasive procedure such as EVLT or stent insertion can offer surprising symptom relief with significant improvement in the quality of life during the twilight years.},

	Abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, controlled, prospective multicenter trial comparing the outcomes of neurogenic intermittent claudication (NIC) patients treated with the interspinous process decompression system (X STOP) with patients treated nonoperatively. OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of the X STOP interspinous implant. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Patients suffering from NIC secondary to lumbar spinal stenosis have been limited to a choice between nonoperative therapies and decompressive surgical procedures, with or without fusion. The X STOP was developed to provide an alternative therapeutic treatment. METHODS.: 191 patients were treated, 100 in the X STOP group and 91 in the control group. The primary outcomes measure was the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire, a patient-completed, validated instrument for NIC. RESULTS: At every follow-up visit, X STOP patients had significantly better outcomes in each domain of the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire. At 2 years, the X STOP patients improved by 45.4% over the mean baseline Symptom Severity score compared with 7.4% in the control group; the mean improvement in the Physical Function domain was 44.3% in the X STOP group and -0.4% in the control group. In the X STOP group, 73.1% patients were satisfied with their treatment compared with 35.9% of control patients. CONCLUSIONS: The X STOP provides a conservative yet effective treatment for patients suffering from lumbar spinal stenosis. In the continuum of treatment options, the X STOP offers an attractive alternative to both conservative care and decompressive surgery.},

	Abstract = {We tested the feasibility of real-time three-dimensional (3D) echocardiographic (RT3DE) imaging to measure left heart volumes at different gravity during parabolic flight and studied the effects of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) as a countermeasure. Weightlessness-related changes in cardiac function have been previously studied during spaceflights using both 2D and 3D echocardiography. Several technical factors, such as inability to provide real-time analysis and the need for laborious endocardial definition, have limited its usefulness. RT3DE imaging overcomes these limitations by acquiring real-time pyramidal data sets encompassing the entire ventricle. RT3DE data sets were obtained (Philips 7500, X3) during breath hold in 16 unmedicated normal subjects in upright standing position at different gravity phases during parabolic flight (normogravity, 1 Gz; hypergravity, 1.8 Gz; microgravity, 0 Gz), with LBNP applied (-50 mmHg) at 0 Gz in selected parabolas. RT3DE imaging during parabolic flight was feasible in 14 of 16 subjects. Data were analyzed (Tomtec) to quantify left ventricular (LV) and atrial (LA) volumes at end diastole and end systole, which significantly decreased at 1.8 Gz and increased at 0 Gz. While ejection fraction did not change with gravity, stroke volume was reduced by 16% at 1.8 Gz and increased by 20% at 0 Gz, but it was not significantly different from 1 Gz values with LBNP. RT3DE during parabolic flight is feasible and provides the basis for accurate quantification of LV and LA volume changes with gravity. As LBNP counteracted the increase of LV and LA volumes caused by changes in venous return, it may be effectively used for preventing cardiac dilatation during 0 Gz.},

	Abstract = {We used intravascular ultrasound to evaluate the incidence, characteristics, and clinical sequel of plaque prolapse within drug-eluting stents. The influence of stent design on plaque prolapse has not been studied. Drug-eluting stents were serially expanded, first at 14 atm and then at 20 atm, with intravascular ultrasound imaging after each inflation. The stent, lumen, and maximum plaque prolapse areas were measured. The residual lumen area and percentage of plaque prolapse burden (maximum plaque prolapse area/stent area) were calculated. Plaque prolapse was divided into grades 1 (<5%), 2 (5% to 10%), and 3 (10% to 20%). Eighty patients (83 lesions, 41 Cypher and 42 Taxus Express stents) were studied. The incidence of plaque prolapse was 41% (17 of 41 lesions) with the Cypher stents versus 24% (10 of 41 lesions) with the Taxus stents after 14 atm (p = 0.096) and 35% (14 of 40) in Cypher stents versus 17.8% (5 of 28) in Taxus stents after 20 atm (p = 0.17). However, the maximum plaque prolapse area was never >20% of the stent area. The frequency and amount of plaque prolapse neither increased nor decreased at higher (20 atm) inflation pressures. Lesions with prolapse were longer (p = 0.004), with a larger external elastic membrane area and greater plaque burden (each p <0.0001) and a larger remodeling index (p = 0.013). Conversely, nonprolapsed plaques had a higher incidence of superficial calcium (p = 0.001). Creatinine kinase-MB elevation was higher with plaque prolapse, and the magnitude of creatinine kinase-MB elevation correlated with the extent of plaque prolapse (r = 0.664, p = 0.002). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that a longer lesion length (p = 0.012), and smaller minimal luminal area (p = 0.031) had higher risks of plaque prolapse. In conclusion, plaque prolapse was frequently observed in Cypher and Taxus stents. However, sequential intravascular ultrasound imaging showed that the frequency and amount of plaque prolapse were neither increased nor decreased by additional higher pressure inflations.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe chronic venous disease frequently has a complex pathophysiology. This study describes results after combined interventions to correct outflow obstruction and superficial reflux, even in the presence of deep venous reflux. METHODS: Between 1997 and 2005, 99 limbs in 96 patients had percutaneous iliofemoral venous stenting combined with great saphenous vein (GSV) stripping (39 limbs), or percutaneous GSV ablation performed by radiofrequency (27 limbs) or laser (33 limbs). Clinical severity score in CEAP was C4 in 51 limbs, C5 in eight limbs, and C6 in 40 limbs; median age was 56 years (range, 27 to 87 years); left-right limb ratio, 2.3:1; female-male ratio, 1.8:1; primary-secondary etiology, 58:41. Perioperative investigations included visual analogue pain scale (VAS), degree of swelling (grade 0 to 3); quality-of-life questionnaire; venous filling index in milliliters per second (VFI90), venous filling time in seconds (VFT), percentage in ambulatory venous pressure drop (AVP), duplex Doppler scanning, and radiologic studies. RESULTS: Clinical follow-up was performed in 97 (98%) of 99 for up to 5.5 years. Axial deep reflux was found in 27% (27/99). At least three venous segments were refluxing in 40% of limbs. Preoperative hemodynamic parameters reflected the presence of reflux and improved significantly (P < .01) after the procedure (VFI90, 3.8 to 2.3 mL/s; VFT, 11 to 16 seconds; AVP, 55% to 65%). No patients died, and the morbidity with endovenous GSV ablation was largely limited to ecchymosis and thrombophlebitis in the thigh area. Cumulative primary, assisted primary, and secondary stent patency rates at 4 years were 83%, 97%, and 97%, respectively. After treatment, limb swelling and pain substantially improved. The rate of limbs with severe pain (>or=5 on VAS) fell from 44% to 3% after intervention. Gross swelling (grade 3) decreased from 30% to 6% of limbs. Cumulative analysis showed sustained complete relief of pain (VAS = 0) and swelling (grade 0) after 4 years in 73% and 47% of limbs, respectively. Ulcers healed in 26 (68%) of 38 ulcerated limbs. Cumulative ulcer-healing rate was 64% at 48 months. All quality-of-life categories significantly improved after treatment. CONCLUSION: The single-stage combination of percutaneous venous stenting and superficial ablation in patients with severe chronic venous disease is safe, gives excellent symptom relief and improvement of quality of life, and a well-maintained ulcer-healing rate. It seems logical to initially perform multiple minimally invasive interventions rather than open surgery. Any associated deep reflux can initially be ignored pending clinical response to the combined intervention.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Chronic obstructions of the inferior vena cava (IVC) are associated with many odd features. Even total occlusions may remain entirely silent or present late with acute symptoms. Renal dysfunction is rare. Many have chronic symptoms, but often only one limb is affected. We describe the clinical features in a series of 120 patients seen over a 10-year period and the results of successful stent placement in 99 limbs. METHODS: Patients with acute onset of symptoms due to distal thromboses underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis. Patients with significant chronic symptoms were investigated by duplex, venous function tests, transfemoral venography and finally intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Stenotic segments were balloon dilated and occluded segments were recannalized when feasible; stents were placed under IVUS control. RESULTS: In the asymptomatic group, 10 patients with total occlusions had transient or no occlusive symptoms. In the acute symptom group, four patients with chronic IVC occlusions presented with acute onset of deep venous thrombosis distal to the occlusion but became asymptomatic when the clot was lysed. In the chronic symptom group, 97 patients (99 limbs) had symptoms of chronic venous disease of variable distribution and intensity. In two-thirds, limb symptoms were unilateral. Pathology was total occlusion in 14%, and the rest were stenoses. The lesion extended above the renal vein in 18%. Common iliac obstruction was concurrent in 93%. Distal reflux was present in 66%. Modifications of the basic stent technique were required in recanalization of total occlusions (four extending up to the atrium), two bilateral stent deployments, and nine IVC filter cases. Stent deployment across the renal and hepatic veins or the contralateral iliac vein had no adverse sequelae. Stent patency (cumulative) at 2 years was 82%. Complete relief (cumulative) of pain and swelling at 3.5 years was 74% and 51%, respectively. The cumulative rate of complete ulcer healing at 2 years was 63%. Overall clinical outcome was rated as good or excellent in 70%. CONCLUSIONS: The unusual clinical features of IVC obstructions seem related to the rich collateralization, which has an embryonic basis. Common iliac vein patency seems to be a crucial link in collateral function, and its concurrent occlusion produces symptoms. Percutaneous stent placement has an emerging role in the treatment of IVC obstructive lesions, with good mid-term stent patency and clinical results.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Nonthrombotic iliac vein lesions (NIVL), such as webs and spurs described by May and Thurner, are commonly found in the asymptomatic general population. However, the clinical syndrome, variously known as May-Thurner syndrome, Cockett syndrome, or iliac vein compression syndrome, is thought to be a relatively rare contributor of chronic venous disease (CVD), predominantly affecting the left lower extremity of young women. The present study describes the much broader disease profile that has emerged with the use of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) scanning for diagnosis and analyzes stent placement outcome in two specific NIVL subsets that may offer clues to their pathogenic role. METHODS: Among 4026 patients with CVD symptoms spanning the range of CEAP clinical classes, IVUS examinations were selectively done in severely symptomatic patients for indications as described. Iliac vein obstructive lesions were found in 938 limbs of 879 patients; 53% of the limbs had NIVL, 40% were post-thrombotic, and 7% were a combination. Stents were placed in 332 limbs in 319 patients in two NIVL subsets. The subsets, one with and one without associated distal limb reflux, were compared. Reflux was left untreated in the first subset. RESULTS: The median age was 54 years (range, 18 to 90 years). The female-male ratio was 4:1 and the left-right ratio was 3:1. NIVL lesions in the iliac vein occurred at the iliac artery crossing (proximal lesion) and also at the hypogastric artery crossing (distal lesion), a new IVUS finding. Venography was only 66% sensitive, with 34% of venograms appearing "normal." IVUS had a diagnostic sensitivity of >90%. The cumulative results observed at 2.5 years after stent placement in the NIVL subsets with reflux and without reflux, respectively, were complete relief of pain 82% and 77%, complete relief of swelling 47% and 53%, complete stasis ulcer healing 67% and 76%, and overall clinical relief outcome 75% and 79%. These results are nearly identical between the two subsets even though distal reflux remained uncorrected in the NIVL plus reflux subset. CONCLUSIONS: NIVL has high prevalence and a broad demographic spectrum in patients with CVD. Similar lesions in the asymptomatic general population may be permissive of future development of CVD. Stent placement alone, without correction of associated reflux, often provides relief.},

Fracture mechanisms such as plaque fissuring and/or dissection occur and constitute major contributions to the lumen enlargement.

We propose physical and finite element models, which are generally useable to trace fissuring and/or dissection in atherosclerotic plaques during balloon angioplasty interventions. The arterial wall is described as an anisotropic, heterogeneous, highly deformable, nearly incompressible body, whereas tissue failure is captured by a strong discontinuity kinematics and a novel cohesive zone model. The numerical implementation is based on the partition of unity finite element method and the interface element method. The later is used to link together meshes of the different tissue components. The balloon angioplasty-based failure mechanisms are numerically studied in 3D by means of an atherosclerotic-prone human external iliac artery, with a type V lesion.

Numerical results show that in a primary phase the plaque fissures at both shoulders of the fibrous cap and stops at the lamina elastica interna. In a secondary phase, local dissections between the intima and the media develop at the fibrous cap location with the smallest thickness.

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of stent placement after infrainguinal loco-regional thrombolysis and iliac thrombectomy (surgical TT) of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with May-Thurner-Syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed a group of 11 patients (9 women) (mean age 34 years, range 16-64 years) with surgical TT and additional intra-operative stenting due to compression of the common iliac vein. Patients underwent venography to demonstrate outflow patency after surgical TT, and to identify any obstruction at the level of the left-sided common iliac vein ("Beckenvenen-Sporn"). Obstruction at the level of arterial crossing was treated using Wallstents placed via an introducer sheath from the inguinal access site. Stents were fully deployed using balloons adjusted to the size of vein. Patients were treated with oral anticoagulants for 6 months, and followed using duplex ultrasonography. RESULTS: Technical success defined as complete vein patency and normal valve function was documented in all 11 patients. One patient needed early stent extension due to residual stenosis. At 6 months follow-up one patient (9%) had an asymptomatic occlusion of the stented common iliac vein. In all 11/11 (100%) patients the femoral segment was found to be patent, and in 1/11 (9%) there was mild reflux with few clinical symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome. The calculated cumulative primary patency rate for venous iliac stents was 82%, and assisted patency rate was 91%, which remained unchanged over a mean follow-up of 22 months. CONCLUSION: Combining surgical TT and stenting of common iliac vein obstructions in DVT is safe, effective, and results in a acceptable venous patency.},

	Abstract = {Coronary restenosis after angioplasty has been reduced by stenting procedure, but in-stent restenosis (ISR) has not been eliminated yet, especially in tortuous vessels. In this paper, we proposed a finite element method (FEM) to study the expansion of a stent in a curved vessel (the CV model) and their interactions. A model of the same stent in a straight vessel (the SV model) was also studied and mechanical parameters of both models were researched and compared, including final lumen area, tissue prolapse between stent struts and stress distribution. Results show that in the CV model, the vessel was straightened by stenting and a hinge effect can be observed at extremes of the stent. The maximum tissue prolapse of the CV model was more severe (0.079 mm) than the SV model (0.048 mm); and the minimum lumen area of the CV was decreased (6.10 mm(2)), compared to that of the SV model (6.28 mm(2)). Tissue stresses of the highest level were concentrated in the inner curvature of the CV model. The simulations offered some explanations for the clinical results of ISR in curved vessels and gave design suggestions of the stent and balloon for tortuous vessels. This FEM provides a tool to study mechanisms of stents in curved vessels and can improve new stent designs especially for tortuous vessels.},

	Abstract = {Nitinol self-expanding stents are effective in treating peripheral artery disease, including the superficial femoral, carotid, and renal arteries. However, fracture occurrences of up to 50% have been reported in some stents after one year. These stent fractures are likely due to in vivo cyclic displacements. As such, the cyclic fatigue and durability properties of Nitinol-based endovascular stents are discussed in terms of an engineering-based experimental testing program. In this paper, the combined effects of cardiac pulsatile fatigue and stent-vessel oversizing are evaluated for application to both stents and stent subcomponents. In particular, displacement-controlled fatigue tests were performed on stent-like specimens processed from Nitinol microtubing. Fatigue data were collected with combinations of simulated oversizing conditions and pulsatile cycles that were identified by computer modeling of the stent that mimic in vivo deformation conditions. These data are analyzed with non-linear finite element computations and are illustrated with strain-life and strain-based constant-life diagrams. The utility of this approach is demonstrated in conjunction with 10 million cycle pulsatile fatigue tests of Cordis SMART Control((R)) Nitinol self-expanding stents to calculate fatigue safety factors and thereby predict in vivo fatigue resistance. These results demonstrate the non-linear constant fatigue-life response of Nitinol stents, whereby, contrary to conventional engineering materials, the fatigue life of Nitinol is observed to increase with increasing mean strain.},

	Abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is primarily an autoimmune disorder of unknown origin. This review focuses iron overload and oxidative stress as surrounding cause that leads to immunomodulation in chronic MS. Iron overload has been demonstrated in MS lesions, as a feature common with other neurodegenerative disorders. However, the recent description of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) associated to MS, with significant anomalies in cerebral venous outflow hemodynamics, permit to propose a parallel with chronic venous disorders (CVDs) in the mechanism of iron deposition. Abnormal cerebral venous reflux is peculiar to MS, and was not found in a miscellaneous of patients affected by other neurodegenerative disorders characterized by iron stores, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Several recently published studies support the hypothesis that MS progresses along the venous vasculature. The peculiarity of CCSVI-related cerebral venous blood flow disturbances, together with the histology of the perivenous spaces and recent findings from advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques, support the hypothesis that iron deposits in MS are a consequence of altered cerebral venous return and chronic insufficient venous drainage.Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism advance online publication, 2 September 2009; doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2009.180.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The extracranial venous outflow routes in clinically defined multiple sclerosis (CDMS) have not previously been investigated. METHODS: Sixty-five patients affected by CDMS, and 235 controls composed, respectively, of healthy subjects, healthy subjects older than CDMS patients, patients affected by other neurological diseases and older controls not affected by neurological diseases but scheduled for venography (HAV-C) blindly underwent a combined transcranial and extracranial colour-Doppler high-resolution examination (TCCS-ECD) aimed at detecting at least two of five parameters of anomalous venous outflow. According to the TCCS-ECD screening, patients and HAV-C further underwent selective venography of the azygous and jugular venous system with venous pressure measurement. RESULTS: CDMS and TCCS-ECD venous outflow anomalies were dramatically associated (OR 43, 95% CI 29 to 65, p<0.0001). Subsequently, venography demonstrated in CDMS, and not in controls, the presence of multiple severe extracranial stenosis, affecting the principal cerebrospinal venous segments; this provides a picture of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) with four different patterns of distribution of stenosis and substitute circle. Moreover, relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive courses were associated with CCSVI patterns significantly different from those of primary progressive (p<0.0001). Finally, the pressure gradient measured across the venous stenosies was slightly but significantly higher. CONCLUSION: CDMS is strongly associated with CCSVI, a scenario that has not previously been described, characterised by abnormal venous haemodynamics determined by extracranial multiple venous strictures of unknown origin. The location of venous obstructions plays a key role in determining the clinical course of the disease.},

	Abstract = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of fracture of Nitinol stents in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) is higher than desirable. Development of more fracture-resistant stents requires a better understanding of in-vivo loads, how stents deform under these loads, and the influence of the artery on stent deformation. In the work reported here, testing devices were designed and constructed to measure loads in stents undergoing tensile, bending, and torsional deformations. Tests to measure mechanical stiffnesses were performed on stents, mock arteries, and stents emplaced in mock arteries. Significant stent/artery interaction was observed under tension and bending; little interaction occurred under torsion loads. The results are explained by changes in stent geometry under load. The deformation, load, and stent/artery interaction information will be useful in validating finite element codes for designing and analyzing stents.},
